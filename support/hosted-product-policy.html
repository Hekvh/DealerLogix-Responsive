					<br>
                    <br>

        <p class="p">&nbsp;This Hosted Product Policy (“Policy”)
        applies to all use of Hosted Products by customers of Dealer Technology Group,
            LLC (“DTG”) and is a part of the agreement (“Agreement”) signed by each customer
        (including all of such customer’s Users, referred to as “you” in this Policy)
            in connection with the use of any DTG Product.&nbsp;
            Capitalized terms not defined in this Policy are defined in the
            Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="p">&nbsp;Each Hosted Product is in whole
            or in part an application accessible remotely through an internet connection,
            and runs on and in connection with the servers, software, routers and other
            equipment supporting that application and its connection to the internet that
            are provided by or on behalf of DTG (all such items are collectively referred
                    to as the “Hosting Environment”).&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="p">&nbsp;The use of each Hosted Product
            you have licensed from DTG is subject to compliance by you with the terms of
            this Policy, and accessing a Hosted Product is acceptance of this Policy.&nbsp; You are responsible for the compliance of
            your Users with this Policy.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="p">&nbsp;You are responsible for all
            hardware, software and connectivity required to access the Hosted Product and
            for your use of the Hosted Product, and for all problems relating to any of
            those items. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="p">&nbsp;<b>Permitted Use</b>.&nbsp; The Hosted
            Environment will only be used by your Users to access and use the Hosted
            Product in compliance with the terms of the Agreement (“Permitted Use”).&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="p">&nbsp;For example, a User will only
            access or attempt to access and use the specific application, data, or file the
            User is authorized to access, and will not attempt to access any other aspect
            of the Hosted Environment or download or store any information or application
            not specifically authorized as a Permitted Use.</p>

            <p class="p"><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Limited Warranty.</b>&nbsp; Hosted
            Products are provided with the following limited warranty, which replaces the
            limited warranty in the Agreement:&nbsp; you
            may notify DTG of any problems you have accessing licensed Hosted Products, and
            DTG will use reasonable efforts to address problems with the Hosting Environment
            affecting your ability to access them.&nbsp;
            Services by DTG to address problems with items other than the Hosting
            Environment are available on a time and materials basis, and DTG reserves the
            right to charge you for time spent addressing problems that are determined to
            be problems with items other than the Hosting Environment.&nbsp;</p>

            the Account in any manner. You will protect and maintain in confidence Account
            numbers and passwords and ensure that only the authorized User has access to
            such User’s information.&nbsp;</p>

            security violations, such as any form of scanning, probing, or other testing or
