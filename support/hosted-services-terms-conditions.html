<p class="p"><b>Hosted Products.</b> Certain Dealerlogix Products are provided by Dealerlogix in a hosted environment where the Dealerlogix Product or a portion of the Dealerlogix Product is not loaded onto your servers or computers but resides on a server owned or contracted by Dealerlogix and is accessed remotely by your authorized Users (each is a “Hosted Product”) through an internet connection. Your right to access and use Hosted Products is subject to your compliance with Dealerlogix’s Hosted Product Policy available at <a href="http://dealerlogix.com/support/hosted-product-policy">Hosted Product Policy</a>.

<p class="p"><b>Limited Remedy and Exclusions.</b> During the Term, so long as you are in compliance with the Agreement, Dealerlogix will use reasonable efforts to cure any breach of the Limited Warranty for which you provide written notice describing the breach in sufficient detail for Dealerlogix to determine the source of the breach. The Limited Warranty does not apply to problems caused by your computer equipment, software or data, by any items not provided by Dealerlogix, or by the actions or omissions of any party other than Dealerlogix. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING DELIVERABLES, ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND Dealerlogix DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Dealerlogix DOES NOT WARRANT THAT PRODUCTS WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Limitations.</b> EXCEPT FOR (1) PAYMENT DUE TO Dealerlogix FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR OTHER AMOUNTS PERMITTED TO BE INVOICED UNDER THE AGREEMENT, (2) A BREACH OF A PARTY’S OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONFIDENTIALITY OR THE LICENSE OR A PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND (3) A PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR (a) AN AMOUNT IN TOTAL GREATER THAN $10,000 OR (b) CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, RELIANCE OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, GOODWILL OR DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF THE CLAIM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE PARTIES DISCLAIM THE PROVISIONS OF, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHTS UNDER, THE UNIFORM COMPUTER INFORMATION TRANSACTIONS ACT AND ANY OTHER LAW THAT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS WAIVED BY THE PARTIES, AND THE TERMS OF ANY SUCH LAW WILL NOT APPLY TO THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.</p>

<p class="p"><b>Compliance.</b> You will comply with all applicable legal and contractual obligations relating to your use of Products and Services, to your business and to the privacy, security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored in or processed by any Product, and you will take appropriate measures to ensure such compliance. You are responsible for determining whether the Products and Services permit you to comply with the legal and contractual obligations that apply to your business and activities, and Dealerlogix does not make any representation or warranty regarding such compliance, except as expressly set forth in the Agreement. </p> 

<p class="p"><b>Infringement.</b> During the Term, so long as you remain in compliance with the Agreement, if any Product is determined in a final judgment, or Dealerlogix determines that it is likely that it may be found, to infringe the rights of any third party arising under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property law, Dealerlogix may obtain the right for you to use such infringing item, provide a reasonable replacement, or by notice terminate your License for the infringing Product and refund the Fee paid for such infringing Product for any time after such termination.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Indemnification.</b> During the Term, so long as you remain in compliance with the Agreement, Dealerlogix will indemnify, defend and hold you harmless from any claims by a third party that any Product in the form delivered by Dealerlogix to the knowledge of Dealerlogix infringes the third party’s rights arising under U.S. patent laws, or infringes any copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right arising under the laws of the United States or any state thereof. You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Dealerlogix and its affiliates and suppliers from any claims by a third party relating to your use of Products and Deliverables except to the extent you are indemnified by Dealerlogix in the preceding sentence.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Termination.</b> The Agreement may be terminated by either party on notice for the breach of the Agreement remaining uncured 10 days after notice from the non-breaching party or if the other party is bankrupt, insolvent, has a receiver appointed for any portion of its business, liquidates, ceases doing business or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Upon a termination by Dealerlogix under this Section, you will owe any Fee that was waived or otherwise not charged by Dealerlogix prior to such termination.  On termination you will immediately destroy, delete and/or return to Dealerlogix all Products and Confidential Information, and you will have no further right to such items. The following Sections of this Agreement will survive termination to the extent applicable thereafter: Deliverables, Payments, Confidentiality, Ownership, Product Ideas, Limitations, Compliance, Indemnification, Termination, Audits, Third Party Software, Arbitration and General Sections.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Audits.</b> Dealerlogix and its licensors may access and audit your systems and records to confirm that you have paid all Fees owed and have otherwise complied with your obligations under the Agreement. If any audit determines that you did not pay all of the Fees you should have paid under the terms of the applicable Order Form, then you will promptly pay the amount owed, and if any audit determines that your underpayment was more than 5% of the total amount of Fees for the period audited, or reveals any other breach of this Agreement, then you will reimburse Dealerlogix or its licensors for the reasonable costs incurred in the audit.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Third Party Software.</b> Certain Products and Services may include third party software or other items subject to additional terms located at <a href="http://dealerlogix.com/support/">http://dealerlogix.com/support/</a>, listed below, or attached to an Order Form, and all of such additional terms are incorporated into and made a part of these Terms and Conditions. Each third party licensing software or other items to Dealerlogix is an intended third party beneficiary of the Agreement and the rights of Dealerlogix (including all provisions that limit liability, restrict warranties and otherwise protect Dealerlogix) under the Agreement will apply to all of such third parties as though references in the Agreement to Dealerlogix are references to such third parties, but no such party has any direct obligations to you under the Agreement except as expressly set forth in a Product and Services Description.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>No Assignment.</b> You may not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under the Agreement. Your subcontractors and employees will comply with the terms of the Agreement applicable to you, and you are responsible for their actions and omissions as though they were your actions and omissions.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Arbitration.</b> Except for temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance which may be obtained in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, any party may provide written notice of a dispute arising under or relating in any way to the Agreement and the parties will have 20 days to try to resolve it informally.  Such notice and resolution period is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before any party can pursue any dispute arising under or relating in any way to the Agreement except for injunctive relief and specific performance.  Any dispute that is not resolved within such 20 day period will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in Denver, Colorado under the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association, and each party agrees to the exclusive resolution of such disputes by arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. <i>et seq</i>) and not state law. Each party will bear one-half of the cost of arbitration charged by the American Arbitration Association. Any court action permitted by this Section may be brought in the courts located in Denver, Colorado and the parties consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Breach of the following Sections will result in irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for which damages are not an adequate remedy, and for which the non-breaching party may obtain temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance without the posting of bond or other security, or if required, then the minimum amount required: License, Hosted Products, Users, Deliverables, Confidentiality, Ownership, Website, Product Ideas, Compliance, Termination, Audits, Third Party Software, No Assignment, and Arbitration Sections.  The parties agree that the Agreement has been performed in Colorado.  Except as expressly provided in the Agreement and except for federal laws that apply to specific matters between the parties, the Agreement and all matters relating to the Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the state of Colorado, not including its choice of law or conflict of law principles.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Force Majeure.</b> The performance of either party, except for the payment of amounts when due, will be excused to the extent the party is unable to perform because of circumstances beyond its reasonable control.</p> 

<p class="p"><b>Severability.</b>  If any provision in the Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be deemed to be revised to the minimum extent necessary to be valid, legal and enforceable, and all other provisions will remain unmodified and binding on the parties.</p>

<p class="p"><b>General.</b> The Agreement is the complete and final agreement of the parties relating to the purchase by you and the delivery by Dealerlogix of any Products and Services and supersedes and cancels any prior communications, representations, understandings and agreements. No different or additional terms set forth in any order form or other document are binding on Dealerlogix unless specifically accepted by Dealerlogix in writing. Modifications to or waivers of any rights under the Agreement will only be effective if in writing signed on behalf of each party. The term “including” means by way of example and not limitation.</p>
